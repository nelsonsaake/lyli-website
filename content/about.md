# THE VIRUS
.Lyli is a virus that corrupts files on a computer. It changes the first 150kb according to [this site](); and adds **.lyli** to the name of the files  it corrupts. \
\
Anything that come after the last dot "." in the name of the file, tell the computer what kind of file it is; and what softwares can read the file. Add .lyli to the end of the file make the file un-recognisable to the computer. If it is removed, the computer can recognise the file.  \
\
The virus also changes what is in the file. So, after correcting the file name some files cannot be recovered. Some file will be partially useful and for others it would be as if no harm was done. Example: If a pdf was corrupted by the virus and the name was corrected. The first page might not show, but everything else will be show.

# THE APP
The current version of the app corrects the name of the file. It **does** not verse the damage done to the content of the file.
