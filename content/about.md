# THE VIRUS
.Lyli is a virus that corrupts files on a computer. It changes the first 150kb according to [this site](); and adds **.lyli** to the name of the files  it corrupts. \
\
What comes after the last dot "." in the name of the file, tells the computer what kind of file it is; and what softwares can open the file. Adding .lyli to the end of the file makes the file un-recognisable to the computer. If it is removed, the computer can recognise the file.  \
\
The virus also changes what is in the file. So, after correcting the file names: some files may still not open. Some file will be partially useful and for others, it would be as if no harm was done. 
Example: If a pdf was corrupted by the virus and the name was corrected. The first page might be corrupted, but everything else will be show.

# THE APP
The current version of the app corrects the name of the file. It **does  not** reverse the damage done to the content of the file.
