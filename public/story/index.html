I have a vague UI in mind, it keeps changing but all is cool. I have a database (DB) structure in mind. I intend to use SQLite. The DB structure is actually sketched. Now, the thing is I'm practically starting from scratch here. I started around Wednesday, the conceptualizing and all. I've read a bit; watched a couple of videos on the SQLite with qt. and qt C++ multithreading. 8 : 1 am  I've started, I want to download the UI SQLite tool to make my database schema before adding the file to the app. Problem\r\rthe DB UI is not the official SQLite site. I will have to search for it. \r 8 : 32 am  Found the SQLite GUI tool I was looking for turns out it is a third-party tool called SQLite studio. URL: https://github.com/pawelsalawa/sqlitestudio/releases/download/3.2.1/InstallSQLiteStudio-3.2.1.exe 10 : 17 am  Schema created and included in assets/database. 10 : 34 am  Attempted continuously to add the project to GitHub and continuously failed, will try again later. At this point is vital to note that I'm not working on this straight. I'm at work, so coding in between tasks. 1 : 27 pm  Between the last entry and now, I have taken a glance at the Qt SQL examples and I'm confident and ready to go forward. The examples are found online on the Qt documentation site. Qt has a great documentation, that’s just by the way. 4 : 52 pm  I borrowed the android concept of database contract class and implemented it. Borrowed as in the only other place I saw this is the Android tutorial on Pluralsight, By Jim Wilson: Managing Android App Data with SQLite.\nIt is about four hours. If you can’t code along, I recommend you at least watch it like some interesting movie series. Then you can refer to it when-ever you like, to pick that info that interests you. Even though it is loaded with information; I would be doing you a great dis-service if I don't mention it is a tutorial video, so, it can easily get boring.  #GADS20 \r #100DAYSOFGADS20 \rI also went ahead to create two widgets to reflect the databases in the application another error hits. Problem\r\rQWidget: Must construct a QApplication before a QWidget \r \r1 / 12 / 2020  9 : 19 am  I found the solution to the error. All had to do was interchange the order of some lines of code in the main. Basically, if a piece of code that will create any widget or UI element; the code must be executed after the QApplication is executed. It might slip through sometimes because, the offending code might be doing so indirectly. Problem\r\rI encountered another problem. Somehow insert data into the database is not working, can't find the problem. \r I've been on this one since yesterday evening around 6:00pm. Slept woke up, keep coming back to the code, referring to the example codes in the Qt online documentation and still I'm getting nowhere. And by the way, I arrived at work about 7:29am. You I said 7:29am because that's when I signed in. 12 : 51 pm  I found the solution to the error. I can't tell what it was, because I don't even know. After refactoring the code for bit. It just started working. Now, I’m trying to simulate continuous entry of data. So, say: the program is continuously supplying data to the database. I want to see how the app will handle displaying it. I have gotten past the continuous entry part. It now left with the display part. Problem\r\rSo far, display the database updates in the UI is not working. It almost as if it blocked by the continuous entry. And, I don't get it because the continuous entry part of the thing is in a different thread. \r 3 : 20 pm  So, I learnt the proper way of dealing with threads in Qt is to use signals and slots. That is, when using the QThreads, and you want objects on different threads to communicate, let them inherit QObject and use signals and slots to communicate. It’s like the async key word in other languages. When using signals and slots to communicate between objects, when a signal is emitted it schedules a call to all the slots. In summary, it makes things simpler and easier. What I was doing was:  5 : 50 pm  Recap: the best way for objects on different threads to communicate in Qt is using QThread: is using signals and slots. It takes cares of making sure the functions are called in their own thread. If there is a take-away from the 3:20pm section, this is it. I'm talking in the context of Qt here. All this dealing with errors reminds me of The Bjarne Stroustrup. All Salute. And to Rob Pike, my respects. Two of the few champions for error handling. At least those I know. By the way, I just got home from work. \r2 / 12 / 2020  8 : 23 am  After my last entry yesterday, I started to doze off. I guess I was tired and I did even know it. I was really surprised. But I went to bed later in the evening. Today is a new day, hopefully no new errors :). I'm already at work. 10 : 7 am  I'm going back to the drawing board. For the first time, I have to think about the structure of the code. Considering in my calculations the use of signals and slots. Ideally, I would like every single query be executed in a different thread. But this is very expensive. And since they will all be trying to access the same database, they would all slow down anyway. So, I'm thinking, one thread for database access, one thread for UI and one thread dealing with the file system. And one thread for the simulation. This is a good time to mention, when I started this, I was considering using 40 thread. Yeah, 40! Maybe I still will: To handle the file system interactions. 6 : 53 pm  I'm back at home. Today was a very busy day at work. There was some betting. Someone bet his car that NPP would win the 2020 election. SMH. I was able to get some few codes in. I refactored the code I had, you know, after the drawing board. The current structure of the code, have the code in segments. And each the segment is on a thread. They communicate via signals and slots. I have 3 main segments. The UI, simulation and the database. Simulation is piece code to check how the app will handle updating the UI, if data is continuously sent to the database. \r3 / 12 / 2020  12 : 27 pm  My 3-segment approach looked promising until I run the code. It gave an error. Problem\r\rThe error was cause by SQL query on one thread, trying to use database on a different thread. \r This is good news because, finally I have the threads working like they are supposed to. And I check online how to deal with this issue. The solution was one connection per thread. As for why the multithreading approach failed the first time: I am certain is because, I made the classes static. If I had my git working, I would have simply referred you to a branch. Example:  The idea was to push everything to different thread from the main. And have that one instance be accessed through-out the entire app. Like a singleton. But that didn't work. I don't know why for sure yet. But I think the reason it didn't work is the same reason I having a DB error now. You can use a QObject of one thread in a different thread without going through the signals and slots. My reasoning is, to create a class that just pops up DB connection using the thread-Id as the connection name. In Qt once you are connected to the database in a particular thread, you can simply execute queries (or access it) without connecting to the database every single time. So, if there is a need to have more than one database you need to qualify it. You do that by using a connection name, and the database name. You can go through the documentation to get acquainted. Documentation available at 6 : 13 pm  \r4 / 12 / 2020  10 : 13 am  I'm starting a new project. With a different code structure. So instead of having the database accessed from multiple threads, we have it one and accessed in that one thread. And that would not be the UI thread. At the start of the program the data would be loaded to the DataManger and the end of the program data will be written back to the database. The data access in any thread throughout the live time of program will live in a QObject called the dataManager. Yesterday I discovered a cool Qt class. QThreadStorage. It is incredible. Check it out. \r5 / 12 / 2020  5 : 06 pm  I've restarted the project. So far so great. This is going great, but I can't get a handle on the code. It is growing incredibly complex and it is difficult to focus on everything. There are way too many branches and way too many things I’m focusing on at once. So, I am going to restart again. I'm not changing anything in code structure. Just going to build the code incrementally. 5 : 54 pm  I would like to take this opportunity to campaign for building codes in a modular manner; AKA divide and conquer. And not just separating the developing the concept from implementation. But also:  Develop the concept in a modular manner. Implement the code in the modular manner.  This way you can focus on only a small piece of the code at a time. It makes refactoring easy. It makes debugging easy, it makes restarting the module easy. Because, now you are not starting the entire code from scratch but just that piece of it. For my backend developers, if you haven't heard of micro-services you should look into it. It's incredible! Interesting! If you just want to explore micro-services, I recommend when you do so use the Go programming language. 6 : 7 pm  Another approach to implementing codes I've seen is doing so incrementally. That is, build the most basic feature, make sure it works. Then add another layer or feature, make sure it works and add another one and another one ... this way you can avoid feature creep. I got this idea from Stroustrup. In fact, the reason I had to restart today is feature creep. I want the code to do something and do it fast. And store it in a database, and UI and UX. And I'm building all of it at once and I finding it difficult to keep it all straight. 10 : 9 pm  I finished the code. It has a simple UI. Three threads. One for target building. Target building is what I call, going through folders and looking for corrupted files and subfolders. That is because files we worked on and folders will be scanned. They become the target information. Here, we are only interested in files that have the .lyli as its extension. The other thread is renaming files and the last thread, is the main thread and is the one with the UI. Problem\r\rI'm having a problem. It appears as if some signals and slots are not working. \r \r7 / 12 / 2020  7 : 38 pm  I didn't really do any work today. I just rewrote some parts of the code to see if it would work. But it just not breaking my way. So, I've decided I will get a different version and Qt tomorrow and try this again. If this doesn't work. I'm going old school C++. No framework, nothing. Just me and the standard libraries. It would be incredible. The snake case naming conversion. Pointers. std::thread, cout 8 / 12 / 2020  11 : 29 am  People, we are back in business. I won't lie I was really disappointed in Qt for a minute there. I was seriously considering Golang for the job and all my hopes on beautiful GUI flashed before my eyes over the weekends. But I have installed newer version of Qt and uninstalled the old one. And things look promising.  First off, I got some errors that the old one did show before. I set a custom font for some UI widgets, the old one wasn't showing the custom fonts but this one is.  So, fingers crossed. Hopefully, by end of day, I will be done. Something fun or something to ignore, whichever you choose you can't be wrong: 011404 09 130125 1903151805 01 04012005. If you can decode this. I will tell you about it. Email: ghuywithissues@gmail.com. Cyrus knows the key btw. Cyrus AKA Cyrusgooddays the musician. 12 : 00 pm  I'm looking at some outputs, it is incredible. 12 : 42 pm  I'm glad to announce after some few bug fixes the code is running. Now I have to create some test sandbox and make sure it works. What next is, add icon, check the UI, even though the thing is running in a different thread the UI is still freezing: I have to check that. And I make my big announcement to anyone who may be concerned that the app is useable. Problem\r\rComponents are in different threads but, UI is still freezing. \r 3 : 14 pm  Solved the UI freezing problem. Basically, I pile up the updates to UI and push them to UI at my own time. So, updates are pushed to UI in an interval of: 100ms (for now). The updates are just to show the user that the program is doing something. So, when it actually appears doesn't really count as long as it’s reasonable. 5 : 8 pm  Let me tell you guys about what the problem with the signals and slots. In the process of adjusting the code to work, I made some mistakes and lack some knowledge. For the type of objects, I was throwing around via signals and slots, I had to register it. I didn't know this and the signals and slots were not working. So: I re-wrote them in a different way. In doing so, I made more mistakes. Code for registering the type:  People, I want to take this opportunity to remember Abraham Lincoln. He said: if I had 10 hours to cut down a tree. I would spend 6 sharping my axe. Your axe is programming is your IDE and \"What you know you don't know\". Before you start make sure you get the best resources available to you and learn those things you know you don't know but you might need. I just came back home about an hour ago. I'm about to make an Icon for the app. At the office I started the process. I wrote .lyli on a piece of paper and took a picture. Now, I'm about to push the pic through an Icon maker app I downloaded via windows store. \r9 / 12 / 2020  10 : 36 am  So now I'm just doing touch ups and testing. It’s left to run test where it will actually rename some files. Next, I will add a cancel feature to allow the user to cancel the process after it started. And I will add a stacked widget to allow user to simply select scan, first side and on the second side, an input to supply a root directory. The second side will be the expert mode. 11 : 17 am  After a few tweaks, rename test went through. 12 : 16 pm  Cancel feature added successfully. 12 : 51 pm  Expert mode and simple interface options have been provided. So, the user doesn't have to deal with the process of selecting folder if they don’t know exactly where to search. At the same time saving time for users who know exactly where to search. 1 : 41 pm  Scan feature implemented in the UI. 2 : 39 pm  Problem\r\rCancel is not working. \r 9 : 19 pm  The cancel is working and software is being packaged. I will finish up when I get the room, currently outside, under some trees on campus. I live in a school bungalow with uncle, his wife, and children. They are interesting cousins really. I love working and enjoying some cool breeze. I took a break earlier after the 2:39 pm log. And I took stroll with a lady. Pretty lady. Yes, developers can take strolls with ladies and have interesting conversation. Back to business, I the past I have used Inno setup to package my software in the past. Inno setup and a couple of others. But I will do some searches and see if there is a new kid on the block. \r16 / 12 / 2020  11 : 17 am  It's been some few days since I worked on this. The only thing left is telling if the task is finished. The entire thing is multithreading. There is no way to know for sure, because the code is not procedural, it is reactive. It waits in response to signals before it does work and when there is no work the QObjects are kept alive until an explicit exit or quit command is given. I have been thinking about this partially, and I thing I have an answer. The UI need to know when to tell the user the scan is finished. So, the approach I'm taking is, if the UI doesn't receive any signals in about 30sec, it would send out a signal like a flare, if the signal returns in due time, then the UI will know it is finished.  \r21 / 12 / 2020  Catch up (Everything I did between the last log and the next) I implemented the finish approach I described in the last my last log. I also went ahead to implement a wrapper around a QWidget that would provide property animation feature. The property I’m animating here is the background color. Problem\r\rAfter this I experienced an unexplainable behavior in the code. It would start, display UI and shortly after just stop. \r There was no error. There were no pointers as to where I might start looking for a solution. I have been since toying with the code, and finally I decided to roll back to the last working version. I did the roll back yesterday. Since I'm not using git. I did the roll back by going through the code and deleting the last added features. After the roll back I also remove the dataManager from the app. The dataManager was supposed to manage the data going through the app. In the dataManager, the data is not stored at any point, just passed around from one function to the other. The dataManager gets the data when it slots are called in response to a signal. It will pass data through some function and send it back out by emitting some signals. Problem\r\rAfter removing the dataManager, one of the signals and slots connection seems to be faulty. The signals are not going through. \r 9 : 58 am  Today, I will attempt a different approach to the whole thing: the focus here is how to know work is done. Work is done when all folders of interest have been scanned and all files of interest have been renamed. Folders of interest includes the folder provided and its subfolders. Files of interest includes any files ending with “.lyli”.   I don't want the member functions to pass around data; I want to store it as a member variable that way they can access it. That way we can point a function to work on member variable and still be adding work to it in another function.  Example: For the renamer, the list of files to be renamed will not be passed to the function, it would be stored as a property (or member variables).  The advantage is if the list is empty = that the renamer is done with its task. Or, An additional check would be added. So, if the additional check passes, and the ranamer list is empty, then the ranamer is done with its work.   For the finish checking, will be done using the approach enumerated above; or maybe with a few added twists. To show the app is finished, we will display, the number of folders scanned, the number of files renamed, the text \"scan completed\". This would not be dumped on the screen all at once but it would be animated. As if it was being typed.  When the code starts the heartbeat animation will be slow. When it is scanning it would be faster, and when it is done scanning it would be even faster. But after scanning the speed will only increase for about 3sec and it would return to slow.  \r26 / 12 / 2020  5 : 31 pm  I’ve implemented point one above. That is, store the data as member and accessible to all member function, instead of passing from as arguments. Point two was to find a way to notify the UI that all work is completed. All work is completed means, folders have been scanned and files have been worked on. I found a better solution to point two. That is, only the file ranamer can tell when the all work is done. So, when folder scanner is done with its work, it would send a signal to the ranamer. Once the ranamer receives that signal and it finishes with its current work load, it would be done! And, there will be for sure no more incoming tasks; so, it would send an all-finished signal to the UI. Indicating that all work related to the scanning is completed. I haven't implemented point four. I implemented point 3 and took it out. Today, with my head in my hands, I'm sad to say, I would have to sacrifice the speed of the project for user experience. It is almost impossible to coordinate the work, that is, different workers over different threads while heavily using the signal and slots. Some signal seems not to be firing and it does make sense to give the customer an extremely fast program if he/she can tell what the program is doing. So, we do a little bit of procedural execution of the entire task here. When the folder scanner is called, it will scan the folder given and all of its subfolders. While scanning, it will compile a list of files to be worked on. Once it's done it will pass the list to the ranamer and the ranamer will do its do. \r3 / 1 / 2021  5 : 23 pm  Between the time I made my last entry and latest 28th I was done with the code and it was working. I also sent it to Alex; it was his computer that was infected, and, ultimately what brought me here to you. After, I played around the UI a bit and lazy-ed around for most part till today. If I hadn't mention: I’ve been on break, actually the whole office was on break, from work since 23rd of Dec 2020; and we are said to resume on the 7th of Jan 2021. I later found out that work actually resumes on 4th, on the 4th. So, I missed work on the 4th. Problem\r\rToday I got the git work. I was git kept failing to push to GitHub, and I was getting an error every time I tried; unfortunately, I cannot share the exact error. I didn’t write it down. The part I can remember is \"curl hung up\" or something similar. I thought maybe the files were too many or there were some files that cannot be written to GitHub. I only get the error when I am pushing to GitHub. \r I removed git from the entire project and added it to the directory containing the source code and the application resources. Viola, it worked. The new plan is to improve on the UI, create some other content on the app and push it all on a website and add ads to it. This way, I can generate some revenue. The new objective is:    clean up the code. - done 12/01/2021 comment the code - done 12/01/2021 talk about some Qt topics related to the code - done 12/01/2021 develop the topics - started 15/01/2021, improve the UI - done 3/01/2021 add a sequential diagram if necessary story of how the app was built, we will call this one “How to magically edit files.” – done error checking and editing 26/01/2021, - some issues that arose as I was writing the code and the solutions I came across or the fixes I found.      Let Komla make me a site Get an AdSense account  Connect the two Share the link on Quora, Stack Overflow (I think it’s time I make an account there), LinkedIn, twitter, Facebook (only in forums that counts not on my main timeline), IG sure if I can find a way that this makes since for IG and any other platform I can find.    \r17 / 1 / 2021  10 : 43 pm  As of two days ago, I had finished restructuring and commenting the code. Today I took some first run at \"the QT related topic\". I walked around and did some audio recording. Next steps:  Go through the recording a make some points. Transcribe the recording if necessary Research missing facts. Work on scenarios and constructs to explain what you want to explain. Find relevant resource and add them.  Output here is PowerPoint documents and a video where I’m presenting using the PowerPoint document. If Komla doesn't get back me on the website, I will contact him again. \r25 / 2 / 2021  8 : 34 am  Komla didn't get back to me, so I decide to do the website myself. I really didn't want to. And so, I've been draging my feet and doing it slowly. Now I've got something. The site is live since 19th Feb 2021 but I'm still working on the content and the UI. I decide to use hugo static site builder. I'm using the PaperMod theme; and adding my own twist to the theme. By 29th of Jan 2021, I had Hugo setup and already trying out themes. And by the 19th of Feb 2021, I had selected my theme and some content and made the site live. Now I'm working on the content and presentation of content. \r ",

By this time, I have concept of what I'm going to be building. <br>
I have a vague UI in mind, it keeps changing but all is cool. <br>
I have a database (DB) structure in mind. <br>
I intend to use SQLite. <br>
The DB structure is actually sketched. <br>
Now, the thing is I'm practically starting from scratch here. <br>
I started around Wednesday, the conceptualizing and all. <br>
I've read a bit; watched a couple of videos on the SQLite with qt. <br>
and qt C++ multithreading. <br>

<div class="story-time">  8 : 1 am </div>
I've started, I want to download the UI SQLite tool to make my database schema before adding the file to the app. <br>

<div class="story-problem">
    <div class="story-problem-title">
        Problem
    </div>
    <div class="story-problem-statement">
         the DB UI is not the official SQLite site. I will have to search for it. 
    </div>
</div> 

<div class="story-time">  8 : 32 am </div>  
Found the SQLite GUI tool I was looking for turns out it is a third-party tool called SQLite studio. <br>
URL: https://github.com/pawelsalawa/sqlitestudio/releases/download/3.2.1/InstallSQLiteStudio-3.2.1.exe <br>

<div class="story-time">  10 : 17 am </div>
Schema created and included in assets/database. <br>

<div class="story-time">  10 : 34 am </div> 
Attempted continuously to add the project to GitHub and continuously failed, will try again later. <br>
At this point is vital to note that I'm not working on this straight. I'm at work, so coding in between tasks. <br>

<div class="story-time">  1 : 27 pm </div> 
Between the last entry and now, I have taken a glance at the Qt SQL examples and I'm confident and ready to go forward. The examples are found online on the Qt documentation site. Qt has a great documentation, that’s just by the way. <br>

<div class="story-time">  4 : 52 pm </div> 
I borrowed the android concept of database contract class and implemented it. Borrowed as in the only other place I saw this is the Android tutorial on Pluralsight, By Jim Wilson: Managing Android App Data with SQLite.<br>
It is about four hours. If you can’t code along, I recommend you at least watch it like some interesting movie series. Then you can refer to it when-ever you like, to pick that info that interests you. Even though it is loaded with information; <br>
I would be doing you a great dis-service if I don't mention it is a tutorial video, so, it can easily get boring. <strong> #GADS20 </strong>
 <strong> #100DAYSOFGADS20 </strong>
 <br>
I also went ahead to create two widgets to reflect the databases in the application another error hits. <br>

<div class="story-date"> 1 / 12 / 2020 </div> 

<div class="story-time">  9 : 19 am </div>
I found the solution to the error. All had to do was interchange the order of some lines of code in the main. <br>
Basically, if a piece of code that will create any widget or UI element; the code must be executed after the QApplication is executed. <br>
It might slip through sometimes because, the offending code might be doing so indirectly. <br>

    <div class="story-problem-statement">
         I encountered another problem. Somehow insert data into the database is not working, can't find the problem. 
    </div>
</div>

I've been on this one since yesterday evening around 6:00pm. Slept woke up, keep coming back to the code, referring to the example codes in the Qt online documentation and still I'm getting nowhere. <br>
And by the way, I arrived at work about 7:29am. You I said 7:29am because that's when I signed in. <br>

<div class="story-time">  12 : 51 pm </div>
I found the solution to the error. I can't tell what it was, because I don't even know. After refactoring the code for bit. It just started working. <br>
Now, I’m trying to simulate continuous entry of data. So, say: the program is continuously supplying data to the database. <br>
I want to see how the app will handle displaying it. I have gotten past the continuous entry part. It now left with the display part. <br>

<div class="story-problem">
    <div class="story-problem-title">
        Problem
    </div>
    <div class="story-problem-statement">
         So far, display the database updates in the UI is not working. It almost as if it blocked by the continuous entry. And, I don't get it because the continuous entry part of the thing is in a different thread. 
    </div>

<div class="story-time">  3 : 20 pm </div> 
So, I learnt the proper way of dealing with threads in Qt is to use signals and slots. That is, when using the QThreads, and you want objects on different threads to communicate, let them inherit QObject and use signals and slots to communicate. <br>
It’s like the async key word in other languages. When using signals and slots to communicate between objects, when a signal is emitted it schedules a call to all the slots. In summary, it makes things simpler and easier. <br>
What I was doing was: 

<script type="application/javascript" src="https://gist.github.com/nelsonsaake/4b041abe62166ff1b5f1d2b4a40beade.js"></script>

	
<div class="story-time">  5 : 50 pm </div>
Recap: the best way for objects on different threads to communicate in Qt is using QThread: is using signals and slots. <br>
It takes cares of making sure the functions are called in their own thread. If there is a take-away from the 3:20pm section, this is it. I'm talking in the context of Qt here. <br>
All this dealing with errors reminds me of The Bjarne Stroustrup. All Salute. And to Rob Pike, my respects. Two of the few champions for error handling. At least those I know. <br>
<br>
By the way, I just got home from work. <br>

<div class="story-time">  8 : 23 am </div>
After my last entry yesterday, I started to doze off. I guess I was tired and I did even know it. I was really surprised. But I went to bed later in the evening. Today is a new day, hopefully no new errors :).  <br>
<br>
I'm already at work. <br>

<div class="story-time">  10 : 7 am </div>
I'm going back to the drawing board. For the first time, I have to think about the structure of the code. Considering in my calculations the use of signals and slots. <br>
Ideally, I would like every single query be executed in a different thread. But this is very expensive. And since they will all be trying to access the same database, they would all slow down anyway. <br>
So, I'm thinking, one thread for database access, one thread for UI and one thread dealing with the file system. And one thread for the simulation. <br>
This is a good time to mention, when I started this, I was considering using 40 thread. Yeah, 40! Maybe I still will: To handle the file system interactions. <br>

<div class="story-time">  6 : 53 pm </div>
I'm back at home. <br>
<br>
Today was a very busy day at work. There was some betting. Someone bet his car that NPP would win the 2020 election. SMH. <br>
I was able to get some few codes in. I refactored the code I had, you know, after the drawing board. The current structure of the code, have the code in segments. And each the segment is on a thread. They communicate via signals and slots. <br>
I have 3 main segments. The UI, simulation and the database. Simulation is piece code to check how the app will handle updating the UI, if data is continuously sent to the database. <br>

<div class="story-date"> 3 / 12 / 2020 </div> 

<div class="story-time">  12 : 27 pm </div>
My 3-segment approach looked promising until I run the code. It gave an error. <br>

<div class="story-problem">
    <div class="story-problem-title">
        Problem
    </div>
    <div class="story-problem-statement">
         The error was cause by SQL query on one thread, trying to use database on a different thread. 
    </div>
</div> 

This is good news because, finally I have the threads working like they are supposed to. And I check online how to deal with this issue. The solution was one connection per thread. <br>
As for why the multithreading approach failed the first time: I am certain is because, I made the classes static.   <br>
If I had my git working, I would have simply referred you to a branch. Example: 

<script type="application/javascript" src="https://gist.github.com/nelsonsaake/debebde77ae4e7509b81f1a90796267c.js"></script>


The idea was to push everything to different thread from the main. And have that one instance be accessed through-out the entire app. Like a singleton. <br>
But that didn't work. I don't know why for sure yet. But I think the reason it didn't work is the same reason I having a DB error now. <br>
You can use a QObject of one thread in a different thread without going through the signals and slots. <br>
<br>
My reasoning is, to create a class that just pops up DB connection using the thread-Id as the connection name. In Qt once you are connected to the database in a particular thread, you can simply execute queries (or access it) without connecting to the database every single time. So, if there is a need to have more than one database you need to qualify it. You do that by using a connection name, and the database name. You can go through the documentation to get acquainted. Documentation available at  <br>

I'm starting a new project. With a different code structure. So instead of having the database accessed from multiple threads, we have it one and accessed in that one thread. <br>
And that would not be the UI thread. At the start of the program the data would be loaded to the DataManger and the end of the program data will be written back to the database. <br>
The data access in any thread throughout the live time of program will live in a QObject called the dataManager. <br>
Yesterday I discovered a cool Qt class. QThreadStorage. It is incredible. Check it out. <br>

<div class="story-time">  5 : 06 pm </div> 
I've restarted the project. So far so great. This is going great, but I can't get a handle on the code. It is growing incredibly complex and it is difficult to focus on everything. There are way too many branches and way too many things I’m focusing on at once. <br>
So, I am going to restart again. I'm not changing anything in code structure. Just going to build the code incrementally. <br>

<div class="story-time">  5 : 54 pm </div> 
I would like to take this opportunity to campaign for building codes in a modular manner; AKA divide and conquer. <br>
And not just separating the developing the concept from implementation. But also:
<ul>
    <li>Develop the concept in a modular manner.</li>
    <li>Implement the code in the modular manner.</li>
</ul>
This way you can focus on only a small piece of the code at a time. It makes refactoring easy. It makes debugging easy, it makes restarting the module easy.  Because, now you are not starting the entire code from scratch but just that piece of it. <br>
For my backend developers, if you haven't heard of micro-services you should look into it. It's incredible! Interesting! <br>
If you just want to explore micro-services, I recommend when you do so use the Go programming language. <br>
 
<div class="story-time">  6 : 7 pm </div>
Another approach to implementing codes I've seen is doing so incrementally. That is, build the most basic feature, make sure it works. Then add another layer or feature, make sure it works and add another one and another one ... this way you can avoid feature creep. I got this idea from Stroustrup. <br>
In fact, the reason I had to restart today is feature creep. I want the code to do something and do it fast. And store it in a database, and UI and UX. And I'm building all of it at once and I finding it difficult to keep it all straight. <br>

<div class="story-time">  10 : 9 pm </div>
I finished the code. <br>
It has a simple UI. Three threads. One for target building. Target building is what I call, going through folders and looking for corrupted files and subfolders. That is because files we worked on and folders will be scanned. They become the target information. <br>
Here, we are only interested in files that have the .lyli as its extension. The other thread is renaming files and the last thread, is the main thread and is the one with the UI. <br>

I didn't really do any work today. I just rewrote some parts of the code to see if it would work. But it just not breaking my way. <br>
So, I've decided I will get a different version and Qt tomorrow and try this again. If this doesn't work. I'm going old school C++. <br>
No framework, nothing. Just me and the standard libraries. It would be incredible. The snake case naming conversion. Pointers. std::thread, cout <<, cerr <<, system(). I will even checkout the C++ returning tuple from a function approach Komla just told me about. Hehehe it would be incredible. <br>
 But really don't want to spend any more time on this project. I want to finish and be done with it ASAP. <br>

People, we are back in business. I won't lie I was really disappointed in Qt for a minute there. I was seriously considering Golang for the job and all my hopes on beautiful GUI flashed before my eyes over the weekends. <br>
But I have installed newer version of Qt and uninstalled the old one. And things look promising. 
<ul>
    <li>First off, I got some errors that the old one did show before.</li>
    <li>I set a custom font for some UI widgets, the old one wasn't showing the custom fonts but this one is.</li>
</ul>
So, fingers crossed. Hopefully, by end of day, I will be done. <br>

I'm looking at some outputs, it is incredible. <br>

<div class="story-time">  12 : 42 pm </div>
I'm glad to announce after some few bug fixes the code is running. Now I have to create some test sandbox and make sure it works. What next is, add icon, check the UI, even though the thing is running in a different thread the UI is still freezing: I have to check that. And I make my big announcement to anyone who may be concerned that the app is useable. <br>

    </div>
</div>

<div class="story-time">  3 : 14 pm </div>
Solved the UI freezing problem. Basically, I pile up the updates to UI and push them to UI at my own time. So, updates are pushed to UI in an interval of: 100ms (for now). <br>
The updates are just to show the user that the program is doing something. So, when it actually appears doesn't really count as long as it’s reasonable. <br>

Let me tell you guys about what the problem with the signals and slots. In the process of adjusting the code to work, I made some mistakes and lack some knowledge. <br>
For the type of objects, I was throwing around via signals and slots, I had to register it. I didn't know this and the signals and slots were not working. So: I re-wrote them in a different way. In doing so, I made more mistakes. <br>
<br>
Code for registering the type:

People, I want to take this opportunity to remember Abraham Lincoln. He said: if I had 10 hours to cut down a tree. I would spend 6 sharping my axe. <br>
Your axe is programming is your IDE and "What you know you don't know". Before you start make sure you get the best resources available to you and learn those things you know you don't know but you might need. <br>
<br>
I just came back home about an hour ago. <br>
<br>
I'm about to make an Icon for the app. At the office I started the process. I wrote .lyli on a piece of paper and took a picture. Now, I'm about to push the pic through an Icon maker app I downloaded via windows store. <br>

So now I'm just doing touch ups and testing. It’s left to run test where it will actually rename some files. <br> 
Next, I will add a cancel feature to allow the user to cancel the process after it started. And I will add a stacked widget to allow user to simply select scan, first side and on the second side, an input to supply a root directory. The second side will be the expert mode. <br>

<div class="story-time">  11 : 17 am </div>
After a few tweaks, rename test went through. <br>

<div class="story-time">  12 : 16 pm </div>
Cancel feature added successfully. <br>

<div class="story-time">  12 : 51 pm </div>
Expert mode and simple interface options have been provided. So, the user doesn't have to deal with the process of selecting folder if they don’t know exactly where to search. At the same time saving time for users who know exactly where to search. <br>

<div class="story-time">  1 : 41 pm </div>

<br>
I will finish up when I get the room, currently outside, under some trees on campus. I live in a school bungalow with uncle, his wife, and children. They are interesting cousins really. I love working and enjoying some cool breeze.  <br>
I took a break earlier after the 2:39 pm log. And I took stroll with a lady. Pretty lady. Yes, developers can take strolls with ladies and have interesting conversation. <br>
<br>
Back to business, I the past I have used Inno setup to package my software in the past. Inno setup and a couple of others. But I will do some searches and see if there is a new kid on the block. <br>

It's been some few days since I worked on this. The only thing left is telling if the task is finished. <br>
The entire thing is multithreading. There is no way to know for sure, because the code is not procedural, it is reactive. It waits in response to signals before it does work and when there is no work the QObjects are kept alive until an explicit exit or quit command is given. <br>
I have been thinking about this partially, and I thing I have an answer. The UI need to know when to tell the user the scan is finished. <br>
So, the approach I'm taking is, if the UI doesn't receive any signals in about 30sec, it would send out a signal like a flare, if the signal returns in due time, then the UI will know it is finished. <br>

 Catch up (Everything I did between the last log and the next)
I implemented the finish approach I described in the last my last log. 
I also went ahead to implement a wrapper around a QWidget that would provide property animation feature. The property I’m animating here is the background color. 

<div class="story-problem">
    <div class="story-problem-title">
        Problem
    </div>
    <div class="story-problem-statement">
         After this I experienced an unexplainable behavior in the code. It would start, display UI and shortly after just stop. 
    </div>
</div>

There was no error. There were no pointers as to where I might start looking for a solution. I have been since toying with the code, and finally I decided to roll back to the last working version. <br>
I did the roll back yesterday. Since I'm not using git. I did the roll back by going through the code and deleting the last added features. <br>
After the roll back I also remove the dataManager from the app. The dataManager was supposed to manage the data going through the app. <br>
In the dataManager, the data is not stored at any point, just passed around from one function to the other. The dataManager gets the data when it slots are called in response to a signal. It will pass data through some function and send it back out by emitting some signals. <br>

    <div class="story-problem-statement">
         After removing the dataManager, one of the signals and slots connection seems to be faulty. The signals are not going through.

<div class="story-time">  9 : 58 am </div>
Today, I will attempt a different approach to the whole thing: the focus here is how to know work is done. Work is done when all folders of interest have been scanned and all files of interest have been renamed. Folders of interest includes the folder provided and its subfolders. Files of interest includes any files ending with “.lyli”. 
<ol>
    <li> I don't want the member functions to pass around data; I want to store it as a member variable that way they can access it. That way we can point a function to work on member variable and still be adding work to it in another function. 
        <ul>
            <li>Example: For the renamer, the list of files to be renamed will not be passed to the function, it would be stored as a property (or member variables). </li>
            <li>The advantage is if the list is empty => that the renamer is done with its task. Or,</li>
            <li>An additional check would be added. So, if the additional check passes, and the ranamer list is empty, then the ranamer is done with its work.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>For the finish checking, will be done using the approach enumerated above; or maybe with a few added twists.</li>
    <li>To show the app is finished, we will display, the number of folders scanned, the number of files renamed, the text "scan completed". This would not be dumped on the screen all at once but it would be animated. As if it was being typed.</li>
    <li> When the code starts the heartbeat animation will be slow. When it is scanning it would be faster, and when it is done scanning it would be even faster. But after scanning the speed will only increase for about 3sec and it would return to slow.</li>
</ol> <br>

I’ve implemented point one above. That is, store the data as member and accessible to all member function, instead of passing from as arguments. <br>
Point two was to find a way to notify the UI that all work is completed. All work is completed means, folders have been scanned and files have been worked on. I found a better solution to point two. That is, only the file ranamer can tell when the all work is done. <br>
So, when folder scanner is done with its work, it would send a signal to the ranamer. Once the ranamer receives that signal and it finishes with its current work load, it would be done! And, there will be for sure no more incoming tasks; so, it would send an all-finished signal to the UI. Indicating that all work related to the scanning is completed. <br>
I haven't implemented point four. I implemented point 3 and took it out.
Today, with my head in my hands, I'm sad to say, I would have to sacrifice the speed of the project for user experience. It is almost impossible to coordinate the work, that is, different workers over different threads while heavily using the signal and slots. <br>
Some signal seems not to be firing and it does make sense to give the customer an extremely fast program if he/she can tell what the program is doing. <br>
So, we do a little bit of procedural execution of the entire task here. When the folder scanner is called, it will scan the folder given and all of its subfolders. While scanning, it will compile a list of files to be worked on. Once it's done it will pass the list to the ranamer and the ranamer will do its do.  <br>

Between the time I made my last entry and latest 28th I was done with the code and it was working. I also sent it to Alex; it was his computer that was infected, and, ultimately what brought me here to you. After, I played around the UI a bit and lazy-ed around for most part till today. <br>

If I hadn't mention: I’ve been on break, actually the whole office was on break, from work since 23rd of Dec 2020; and we are said to resume on the 7th of Jan 2021. I later found out that work actually resumes on 4th, on the 4th. So, I missed work on the 4th.  <br>

         Today I got the git work. I was git kept failing to push to GitHub, and I was getting an error every time I tried; unfortunately, I cannot share the exact error. I didn’t write it down. The part I can remember is "curl hung up" or something similar. I thought maybe the files were too many or there were some files that cannot be written to GitHub. I only get the error when I am pushing to GitHub. 
    </div>
</div>

 I removed git from the entire project and added it to the directory containing the source code and the application resources. Viola, it worked. 

The new plan is to improve on the UI, create some other content on the app and push it all on a website and add ads to it. This way, I can generate some revenue. The new objective is:

<ol>
    <li>
        <ul>
            <li>clean up the code. - done 12/01/2021</li>
            <li>comment the code - done 12/01/2021</li>
            <li>talk about some Qt topics related to the code - done 12/01/2021</li>
            <li>develop the topics - started 15/01/2021,</li>
            <li>improve the UI - done 3/01/2021</li>
            <li>add a sequential diagram if necessary</li>

            <li>some issues that arose as I was writing the code and the solutions I came across or the fixes I found.

            <li>Get an AdSense account </li>
            <li>Connect the two</li>
            <li>Share the link on Quora, Stack Overflow (I think it’s time I make an account there), LinkedIn, twitter,
                Facebook (only in forums that counts not on my main timeline), IG sure if I can find a way that this
                makes since for IG and any other platform I can find.</li>

As of two days ago, I had finished restructuring and commenting the code. Today I took some first run at "the QT related topic". 
I walked around and did some audio recording. Next steps:
<ul>
    <li>Go through the recording a make some points.</li>
    <li>Transcribe the recording if necessary</li>
    <li>Research missing facts.</li>
    <li>Work on scenarios and constructs to explain what you want to explain.</li>
    <li>Find relevant resource and add them.</li>
</ul>
<br>
Output here is PowerPoint documents and a video where I’m presenting using the PowerPoint document. <br>
<br>
If Komla doesn't get back me on the website, I will contact him again. <br>

Komla didn't get back to me, so I decide to do the website myself. I really didn't want to. And so, I've been draging my feet and doing it slowly. <br>
<br>
Now I've got something. The site is live since 19th Feb 2021 but I'm still working on the content and the UI. I decide to use hugo static site builder. I'm using the PaperMod theme; and adding my own twist to the theme.  <br>
<br>
By 29th of Jan 2021, I had Hugo setup and already trying out themes. And by the 19th of Feb 2021, I had selected my theme and some content and made the site live. Now I'm working on the content and presentation of content.  <br>
